The stock market has historically been difficult for machine learning techniques to fit predictive models. We will be tackling this problem using the larger amounts of data available nowadays as well as more advanced machine learning techniques. Specifically, we will be examining the ability of the news to forecast changes in the stock market. We will be predicting the impact of business news articles on the daily stock market changes for several companies in major sectors in the US. For example, announcements of tariffs in the news can cause agricultural stocks to dip.
